The program is a simulation for a modern medicine shop managed through a console interface. It provides different functionalities for managers and customers, including adding and removing products, viewing inventory, and processing orders based on priority. The ManagerEntry class allows managers to add or remove items from the shop, view action history, and save the shop's final state. The Storeditem class manages the inventory using a binary search tree (BST), reading items from a file and providing a menu to search or display all items. The CustomerOrder class lets customers set their information, add or remove items from their cart, and display the cart contents, with options to save orders to a file. Orders are prioritized using the checkorder class, which processes customer orders based on their priority and displays them. The main function presents a menu for selecting either manager or customer functionalities, with options to sign out, and utilizes system-specific commands to clear the screen. The program ensures efficient handling of shop operations through structured classes and priority queues.
